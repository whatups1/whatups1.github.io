        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nick Waddoups and I am studying Honors Computer Science at the University of Utah.  My areas of interest are primarily
            mobile app development, database management, and machine learning.
            Currently, I am working as a research intern at Boom Interactive, a Salt Lake City-based startup. 
            At Boom Interactive, we're exploring the integration of artificial intelligence into the 3D space. 
            My role involves contributing to various projects, which have provided invaluable hands-on experience alongside my academic endeavors.
            While attending university, I've had the opportunity to engage in smaller projects that help the company.  I'm eager to delve into more significant projects, particularly during the upcoming summer.
            I am very passionate about this industry and am committed to continuous learning and growth. Each experience fuels my enthusiasm and motivates me to explore new paths within the field of computer science.
