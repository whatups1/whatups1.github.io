        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nick Waddoups and I am studying Honors Computer Science at the University of Utah.  My areas of interest are primarily
            mobile app development, database management, and machine learning.
            Currently, I am working as a research intern at Boom Interactive, a Salt Lake City-based startup. 
            At Boom Interactive, we're exploring the integration of artificial intelligence into the 3D space. 
            My role involves contributing to various projects, which have provided invaluable hands-on experience alongside my academic endeavors.
            While attending university, I've had the opportunity to engage in smaller projects that help the company.  I'm eager to delve into more significant projects, particularly during the upcoming summer.
            I am very passionate about this industry and am committed to continuous learning and growth. Each experience fuels my enthusiasm and motivates me to explore new paths within the field of computer science.

        <div class="Pixel Sprite Editor">
            <h3>Pixel Sprite Editor</h3>
            <p>The Pixel Sprite Editor is a tool designed for creating and editing pixel art sprites. 
                It provides a straightforward interface for users to craft 2D art, commonly used in games, animations, etc.
                The editor features pixel mirroring, object fill, and multiple pen sizes.

        <div class="Learning Management System">
            <h3>Learning Management System</h3>
            <p> For the final project in the Database Management elective, my partner and I developed a Learning Management System 
                (LMS) using C# with MySQL for the database backend.

                The LMS comprised several essential components, including tables for managing students, teachers, 
                classes, grades, and time slots. These tables facilitated efficient organization and retrieval of 
                data necessary for the system's functionality.

        <div class="Hiking and Weather App">
            <h3>Hiking and Weather App</h3>
            <p> Using Android Studio and Kotlin, I developed an app capable of retrieving and displaying current weather information. 
                The app fetches data from an online database and parses JSON data based on the user's location.
                In addition to providing weather updates, the app offers a feature to explore local hiking trails. 
                Users can navigate to this functionality through a separate fragment, and learn about these hikes.  
                This data was acquired through the Google Maps API.
